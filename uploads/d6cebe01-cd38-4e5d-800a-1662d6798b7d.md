- **Role/Persona:** Assign the AI a specific identity or viewpoint (e.g., "Act as a data analyst," "You are a travel guide," "Act as an executive coach"). This helps ensure the tone and style of the response are appropriate for the desired context.
- **Task/Goal:** Clearly state what you want the AI to do. Use action-oriented verbs (e.g., "Summarize," "Draft," "Explain," "Generate"). Avoid vague language to prevent ambiguity.
- **Context/Details:** Provide background information, specific parameters, target audience, or any constraints that will help the AI understand the nuance of your request. This is crucial for targeted and accurate results.
- **Format:** Specify how you want the output structured (e.g., "in bullet points," "as a formal email," "a 500-word report," "a JSON object," "with headings and subheadings").
- **Tone/Style:** Define the desired style of writing (e.g., "professional," "casual," "academic," "humorous," "concise"). This ensures the output matches your brand or specific needs.
- **Examples (Few-Shot Prompting):** If a specific structure or style is important, provide one or more examples of the desired input-output pattern. This is a powerful technique for achieving consistent results.
