Re: IT Systems Manager - AI Evaluation Role

Dear Hiring Team,
I am writing to express my strong interest in the IT Systems Manager position at Turing. With 18+ years of progressive experience in enterprise technology leadership, systems management, and complex project delivery, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute my expertise to advance AI systems that will transform how enterprises leverage technology.
Why This Role Resonates With Me
Your mission to accelerate frontier AI research while helping enterprises transform AI from proof of concept into proprietary intelligence aligns perfectly with my career trajectory. Throughout my career, I have bridged the gap between complex technical systems and real-world business impact—precisely the mindset needed to design meaningful AI evaluation scenarios and assess AI responses for practical enterprise applications.
The prospect of contributing to AI development without requiring prior AI experience is particularly compelling. My strength has always been approaching technical challenges from first principles, understanding system requirements deeply, and designing solutions that work in complex, real-world environments. These skills translate directly to creating robust test scenarios for AI reasoning.
What I Bring to Turing
1. Deep IT Systems Management Expertise
Over nearly two decades, I have designed, implemented, and managed enterprise systems serving millions of users across telecommunications, government, finance, education, and utilities sectors. My experience spans:

IT Governance & Strategy: As CTO of Tekeniko Solutions for the past 10 years, I've established IT governance frameworks, security protocols, and technology roadmaps aligned with business objectives
System Integration: Successfully integrated complex systems across multiple platforms, from payment gateways for the Zambia Revenue Authority to multi-channel customer service platforms for national utilities
Cybersecurity & Compliance: Implemented security protocols achieving 99.9% uptime while maintaining regulatory compliance across sensitive sectors including government, finance, and telecommunications
Enterprise Infrastructure: Architected scalable solutions handling millions of concurrent users, from processing 3 million calls daily to serving 5+ million utility customers

2. Proven Project Leadership Across Complex Scenarios
I have successfully led projects that mirror the complexity and stakeholder diversity you'll need AI systems to understand:

Distributed Team Management: Led a 17-developer team across India, Kenya, Uganda, and Zambia for the Roger Federer Foundation's educational technology initiative
Multi-Stakeholder Coordination: Managed the Electoral Commission of Zambia's voter result transmission system involving 30 engineers, multiple government agencies, and telecommunications providers
Rapid Problem-Solving: Completed the GeoPoll survey platform 3 months ahead of schedule while serving 500,000+ daily users
Crisis Management: Enabled 7 schools to transition to online learning during COVID-19 through my School Management Information System

These experiences have honed my ability to break down complex operational scenarios, identify critical decision points, and articulate clear, structured solutions—exactly what's needed to create effective AI test cases.
3. Technical Breadth Spanning Modern Enterprise Systems
My technical foundation encompasses the full stack of enterprise technology:

Cloud & Infrastructure: Experience with cloud architecture design and familiarity with AWS, Azure, and GCP concepts through vendor evaluations and infrastructure planning
Development & APIs: 12+ years with PHP/MySQL, 7+ years with Python and Java, extensive RESTful and SOAP API design
Databases: Expertise across SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB, Redis, CouchDB) platforms
Security & Networking: VPN architecture, network protocols, Layer 2 networking, system security management
Enterprise Integration: Successfully integrated systems with mobile network operators, payment providers, government agencies, and third-party platforms

4. Excellence in Technical Communication
Throughout my career, I have excelled at translating technical complexity into clear documentation:

Created comprehensive technical specifications for government projects requiring regulatory compliance
Developed training materials that enabled hundreds of thousands of untrained teachers to use technology effectively
Written proposals and reports for diverse stakeholders from technical teams to executive leadership
Documented system architectures for enterprise-scale applications serving millions of users

This skill directly translates to writing clear, structured solutions for AI evaluation and assessing AI responses for accuracy and professionalism.
Why I'm Excited About AI Evaluation
The opportunity to contribute to AI advancement while leveraging my IT expertise is genuinely exciting for several reasons:
Intellectual Challenge: Designing scenarios to test AI reasoning about IT operations, governance, and strategic planning will require the same creative problem-solving I've applied throughout my career—but in an entirely new context.
Meaningful Impact: Having spent my career building systems that improve people's lives—from enabling rural education to streamlining government services—I'm motivated by Turing's mission to ensure AI systems deliver measurable, reliable results for enterprises.
Learning Opportunity: While I bring deep IT expertise, I'm eager to understand how AI systems reason about technology problems. This role offers a unique window into the cutting edge of AI development while allowing me to contribute meaningfully from day one.
Bridge Between Worlds: My career has been about connecting technical possibility with practical necessity. Helping AI systems better understand enterprise technology challenges feels like a natural extension of this work.
Addressing the Remote Nature of This Role
Remote, distributed work is second nature to me. I have successfully:

Managed teams across four countries and multiple time zones (India, Kenya, Uganda, Zambia)
Delivered complex projects requiring daily coordination across geographically dispersed team members
Maintained clear communication channels using collaboration tools, documentation, and structured check-ins
Built trust and accountability in remote teams through consistent delivery and transparent communication

My location in Zambia has taught me to be proactive, organized, and crystal-clear in written communication—skills that will serve me well in evaluating AI systems and collaborating with Turing's research team.
Understanding the Role's Demands
I recognize this position requires:

Precision: Creating unambiguous test scenarios and evaluation criteria
Breadth: Understanding diverse IT challenges across industries and contexts
Critical Thinking: Assessing AI responses not just for correctness but for practical applicability
Collaboration: Working effectively with AI researchers who bring different expertise
Adaptability: Learning Turing's evaluation frameworks and adjusting to new project requirements

My track record demonstrates all of these capabilities. Every project I've led required precise specifications, cross-domain thinking, rigorous quality assurance, multi-disciplinary collaboration, and rapid adaptation to changing requirements.
Looking Forward
I am particularly drawn to Turing's dual mission: advancing frontier AI research while helping enterprises deploy AI that delivers real business results. Having spent my career in emerging markets where resources are constrained and solutions must work reliably from day one, I deeply appreciate the importance of AI systems that perform consistently and deliver measurable value.
The prospect of a one-month engagement with potential extension is ideal. It allows both parties to assess fit while giving me the opportunity to demonstrate the value of my enterprise technology perspective in AI evaluation work.
I am confident that my combination of deep IT systems expertise, project leadership experience, technical communication skills, and genuine curiosity about AI development makes me a strong candidate for this role. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background aligns with Turing's needs and to learn more about the specific AI evaluation projects you're pursuing.
Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to Turing's mission of advancing reliable, impactful AI systems for enterprises worldwide.
Sincerely,
Mundiya M. Kwalomvota
